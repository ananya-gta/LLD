Factory design pattern is  a creational design pattern
which encapsulates the object creation logic and
allows the clients to create object without knowing their concrete classes.

Real-World Usage
-Logger creation
-Database connection objects
-Payment gateways
-UI component creation
-Spring Beans (BeanFactory)

Below are the main components of Factory Design Pattern:

-Product: Abstract interface or class for objects created by the factory.
-Concrete Product: The actual object that implements the product interface.
-Creator (Factory Interface/Abstract Class): Declares the factory method.
-Concrete Creator (Concrete Factory): Implements the factory method to create specific products.

creator/ factory abstract class that defines a factory method
concrete factories decide which specific object to create -- what is created
