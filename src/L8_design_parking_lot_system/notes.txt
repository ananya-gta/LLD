Interview perspective:

interviewer : design a parking lot system

you: here's my understanding,

- The system manages different vehicle types
- The vehicles enter & exit (only after making the payment)
- parking space/lot is assigned upon entry and freed upon exit
- payment must be completed before leaving
- system handles different vehicle sizes and slot allocations efficiently.

is this the expected flow?

interviewer: yes

you: before proceeding further, I would like to clarify a few requirements

- will there be multiple slot typed based on vehicle size?
- are we supporting multiple payment methods?
- should the system track the parking duration ?
- can there be multiple floors in the parking lot ?
- any other core requirement ??

interviewer: clarifying requirements
- the system should support vehicle types (bike, car, truck)
- has different slot sizes based on vehicle type
- allows multiple payment methods
- ensure smooth entry/exit wth accurate parking fee calculation
